Hello All! My name is Mason Teschler and I am a Game design Student at Southwest Career and Technical Academy in Las Vegas Nevada! Currently, I am striving to complete my 1 1/2 years of highschool that I have left and start on my career of being a United States Air force Pilot. Currently, I have been Mountain biking for 4 years in and out of Las Vegas and am a Cadet Airman in the Civil Air Patrol out near Henderson Executive Airport Nevada. my biggest interests in game development would be creating a virtual realisitic flight simulator containing mostly fighter attack aircrafts. I hope in a game like this I can allow my players to immerse themselves in the plane of their choice and learn what its like to be a fighter pilot using a simulator. Whether that be on an airfield or an Aircraft Carrier, anyone interested in millitary aviation should consider playing it. In the future, I want to strive to incoperating aircrafts such as F-16C Fighting Falcon, f-18E Super Hornet, and the A-10 Warthog and try to make them as realilistic as possible to those who are looking for a real experience on what its like to fly that aircraft in real life. I look forward to talking to people who are interested in millitary aviation and just aviation in general as one of my other goals in life (After being a USAF pilot) is to be a Commercial Airline Pilot.
